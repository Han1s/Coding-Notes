# 1. Introduction

## 1. What is GraphQL

- a bit like SQL but for APIs
- the reason is because you can ask for exactly what you need while with REST you always get all the data (overfetching)
- GQL lets you get many requests in a single requests (that solves underfetching)
- you describe what is possible with a system schema
- has **graphical**
- offers a way to deprecate fields
- **GQL** always makes a POST request (json payload, json response)
